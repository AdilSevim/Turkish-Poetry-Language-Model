# Turkish-Poetry-Language-Model
This Turkish Poetry LLM began in 2021, when I was 13. The current release preserves the original architecture while being comprehensively revised for quality, reliability, and usability, and published on 01 August 2025. Training data draws on Mrjavaci/Turkish-Poems; earlier versions used a dataset curated by me.
